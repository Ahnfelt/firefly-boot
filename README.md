# firefly-boot
This is a bootstrap trainspiler for converting Firefly code to Scala code.

Status: Firefly has been bootstrapped and now transpiles itself into Scala.

Sometimes you need to eta-expand to make the Scala type inference happy, and the semantics aren't 100% as they would be in a full implementation of Firefly. 
I do belive it's close enough to rewrite the rest of the compiler in Firefly now though.
