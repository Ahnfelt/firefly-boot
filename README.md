# firefly-boot
This is a bootstrap trainspiler for converting Firefly code to Scala code.

Sometimes you need to eta-expand to make the Scala type inference happy, and the semantics aren't 100% as they would be in a full implementation of Firefly. 
I do belive it's close enough to rewrite the compiler in Firefly now though, so that the bootstrap process can be completed.
